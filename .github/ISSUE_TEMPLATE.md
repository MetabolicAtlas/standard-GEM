### Description of the issue:
*Try to be as clear as possible: Is it something wrong/missing in the model? Is it a simulation issue? PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE.*


#### Expected feature/value/output:
*How the reaction/metabolite/gene/simulation result should look (cite literature if needed). PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE.*


#### Current feature/value/output:
*How the reaction/metabolite/gene/simulation actually looks in the `main` branch. PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE.*


#### Reproducing these results:
*Please attach any code used below (if it's python code replace the keyword "matlab" with "python". PLEASE DELETE THIS LINE.*
```matlab

```

**I hereby confirm that I have:**
- [ ] Tested my code with [all requirements](https://github.com/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM#required-software---user) for running the model
- [ ] Done this analysis in the `main` branch of the repository
- [ ] Checked that a similar issue does not exist already
- [ ] If needed, asked first in the [Gitter chat room](https://gitter.im/SysBioChalmers/yeast-GEM) about the issue
